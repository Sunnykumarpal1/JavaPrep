# Spring Boot Starter Dependencies

A **Spring Boot starter dependency** is a pre-packaged set of dependencies provided by Spring Boot for a specific purpose, such as building a web application, working with databases, or adding security.

Instead of manually adding multiple libraries, you can include a single starter, and it will bring all the required dependencies automatically.

## Example

### spring-boot-starter-web

The `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency includes:

- Spring MVC
- Jackson (for JSON processing)
- Embedded Tomcat server

This allows you to quickly create a REST API without manually configuring these components.
